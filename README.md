# worldcup_predictor ‚öΩ üèÜ
## simulate the world cup competition by predicting every match outcome and explore all the possibilities 
i've wanted to predict the world cup results ,but most apps i've found online don't allow for a match by match score prediction in the group stage or other stages,
so i decided to make it myself!
